Data Engineering Project

Project Overview

This data engineering project focuses on processing and managing data from the Spotify API. The goal is to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data efficiently using Python, AWS services, and Snowflake. The processed data is stored in Amazon S3 and later loaded into Snowflake for further analysis and insights.

Data Flow

The workflow involves several key steps as depicted in the diagram:

Fetch Spotify Data:

Operator: PythonOperator

This step involves connecting to the Spotify API to fetch raw data related to songs, artists, and albums.

Upload Raw Data to S3:

Operator: S3CreateObjectOperator

The fetched data is uploaded as raw JSON or CSV files into a designated S3 bucket.

Read Data from S3:

Operator: PythonOperator

The raw data stored in S3 is retrieved for processing. This step ensures the data is ready for transformation.

Process Data:

Subtasks:

Process Song Data: Transforms raw song data into a structured format.

Operator: PythonOperator

Process Artist Data: Cleans and structures artist-related information.

Operator: PythonOperator

Process Album Data: Prepares album-related data for storage.

Operator: PythonOperator

Store Processed Data to S3:

Subtasks:

Store Song Data: Saves processed song data into a designated S3 bucket.

Operator: S3CreateObjectOperator

Store Artist Data: Stores structured artist data in S3.

Operator: S3CreateObjectOperator

Store Album Data: Uploads processed album data to S3.

Operator: S3CreateObjectOperator

Move Processed Data:

Operator: PythonOperator

This step organizes and consolidates all processed data, preparing it for downstream consumption, such as analytics or machine learning.

Load Data into Snowflake:

Tools: Snowpipe, Snowflake

The processed data stored in S3 is loaded into Snowflake using Snowpipe. This step ensures the data is ingested into the Snowflake data warehouse in a structured and queryable format.

Workflow Execution

The workflow is orchestrated using Python, with tasks defined and executed sequentially or in parallel as necessary.

The PythonOperator handles custom Python scripts for data extraction and transformation.

The S3CreateObjectOperator is used for saving data to S3, ensuring that the raw and processed data is efficiently managed and accessible.

Snowpipe automates the loading of processed data from S3 into Snowflake.

AWS and Snowflake Integration

Amazon S3: Acts as the central storage for both raw and processed data.

Python: Used to fetch, process, and manipulate the data throughout the pipeline.

Snowpipe and Snowflake: Enables real-time data ingestion and provides a powerful data warehouse for analytics.

This project structure ensures a scalable and modular approach to data engineering, providing a clear path for enhancements and integrations in the future.
